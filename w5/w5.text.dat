Modern hardware has supported parallel processing for some time and optimal use of modern hardware requires parallel programming.  Unlike serial computation, which uses one processer and requires code that executes instructions in sequence one after the other, parallel computing uses multiple processors and requires code that executes several instructions concurrently.  As computational demands increase in complex, they push at the limits of computability and the need for parallel programming grows.
